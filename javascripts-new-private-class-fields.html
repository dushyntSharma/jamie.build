<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields#private-fields">Private
  class fields</a> are now at
  <a href="https://tc39.github.io/process-document/">Stage 2</a> in the
  JavaScript standard process. It's not finalized yet, but the JavaScript
  standards committee expects the feature to be developed and eventually
  included in the standard (although it may still change).
</p>

<p>
  The syntax (currently) looks like this:
</p>

<pre><code>class Point {
  <em>#x;</em>
  <em>#y;</em>

  constructor(x, y) {
    <em>this.#x</em> = x;
    <em>this.#y</em> = y;
  }

  equals(point) {
    return <em>this.#x</em> === <em>point.#x</em> &amp;&amp; <em>this.#y</em> === <em>point.#y</em>;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  There are two main parts of this syntax:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Defining private fields</li>
  <li>Referencing private fields</li>
</ol>

<h2>
  Defining Private Fields
</h2>

<p>
  Defining private fields is mostly the same as defining public fields:
</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
  publicFieldName = 1;
  <em>#privateFieldName = 2;</em>
}</code></pre>

<p>
  In order to access a private field, you need to have defined it. So in case
  you don't want to instantiate a value when defining the property, you can do
  so:
</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
  <em>#privateFieldName;</em>
}</code></pre>

<h3>Referencing Private Fields</h3>

<p>
  Referencing private fields works similar to accessing any other property,
  only it has a special syntax.
</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
  publicFieldName = 1;
  <em>#privateFieldName</em> = 2;
  add() {
    return this.publicFieldName + <em>this.#privateFieldName</em>;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  There's also a shorthand version of <code>this.#</code>:
</p>

<pre><code>method() {
  <em>#</em>privateFieldName;
}</code></pre>

<p>
  Which is the same as:
</p>

<pre><code>method() {
  <em>this.#</em>privateFieldName;
}</code></pre>

<h2>Referencing private fields of instances</h2>

<p>
  Referencing private fields isn't just limited to <code>this</code>. You can
  also access private fields on values that are instances of your class:
</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
  #privateValue = 42;
  static getPrivateValue(<em>foo</em>) {
    return <em>foo.#privateValue</em>;
  }
}

Foo.getPrivateValue(<em>new Foo()</em>); // >> 42</code></pre>

<p>
  Here, <code>foo</code> is an instance of <code>Foo</code> so we are allowed
  to lookup <code>#privateValue</code> from within the class definition.
</o>

<h2>Private Methods (coming soon?)</h2>

<p>
  Private fields are coming as part of a
  <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields">proposal</a> focusing
  on just adding class fields. The proposal does not make any changes to class
  methods, so private class methods will be coming in a
  <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-private-fields/blob/master/METHODS.md">followup
  proposal</a> and will likely look like this:
</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
  constructor() {
    <em>this.#method();</em>
  }
  <em>#method() {</em>
    // ...
  <em>}</em>
}</code></pre>

<p>
  In the meantime, you can still assign functions to private fields:
</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
  constructor() {
    <em>this.#method();</em>
  }

  <em>#method = () => {</em>
    // ...
  <em>};</em>
}</code></pre>

<h2>Encapsulation</h2>

<p>
  If you're using an instance of a class, you cannot reference that class's
  private fields. You can only reference private fields from within the class
  that defines them.
</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
  #bar;
  method() {
    <em>this.#bar;</em> // Works
  }
}
let foo = new Foo();
<em>foo.#bar;</em> // Invalid!</code></pre>

<p>
  Further, to be truly private, you shouldn't be able to even detect that a
  private field exists.
</p>

<p>
  In order to make sure that you can't detect a private field, we need to allow
  public fields with the same name.
</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
  <em>bar</em> = 1; // public bar
  <em>#bar</em> = 2; // private bar
}</code></pre>

<p>
  If private fields didn't allow for public fields with the same name, you
  could detect the private fields existence by trying to write to a property of
  the same name:
</p>

<pre><code>foo.bar = 1; // <em>Error: `bar` is private! (boom... detected)</em></code></pre>

<p>
  Or the silent version:
</p>

<pre><code>foo.bar = 1;
foo.bar; // <em>`undefined` (boom... detected again)</em></code></pre>

<p>
  This encapsulation should also be true for subclasses. A subclass should be
  able to have a field of the same name without having to worry about the
  parent class.
</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
  <em>#fieldName</em> = 1;
}

class Bar extends Foo {
  <em>fieldName</em> = 2; // Works!
}</code></pre>

<h2>So why the hashtag?</h2>

<p>
  A lot of people are wondering "why not follow conventions from many other
  languages and use a <code>private</code> keyword"?
</p>

<p>
  Here's an example of that syntax:
</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
  <em>private value;</em>

  equals(foo) {
    return <em>this.value</em> === <em>foo.value</em>;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  Let's look the two parts of the syntax separately.
</p>

<h3>
  Why don't declarations use the private keyword?
</h3>

<p>
  The private keyword is used in a lot of different languages to declare
  private fields.
</p>

<p>
  Let's look at the syntax of language like that:
</p>

<pre><code>class EnterpriseFoo {
  <em>public bar;</em>
  <em>private baz;</em>
  method() {
    this.bar;
    this.baz;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  In these languages, public and private fields are accessed the same way. So
  it makes sense that they get defined this way.
</p>

<p>
  However, in JavaScript, because we can't use this.field for private
  properties (which I'll get to in a second), we need a way of syntactically
  communicating the relationship. By using the # in both places, it's much
  clearer what is being referenced.
</p>

<h3>Why do references need the <code>#hashtag</code>?</h3>

<p>
  We need to use <code>this.#field</code> instead of <code>this.field</code>
  for a couple reasons:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Because of <strong>#encapsulation</strong> (<em>see the "Encapsulation"
    section above</em>), we need to allow public and private fields with the
    same name at the same time. So accessing a private field can't just be a
    normal lookup.
  </li>
  <li>
    Public fields in JavaScript can be referenced via <code>this.field</code>
    or <code>this['field']</code>. Private fields won't be able to support the
    second syntax (because it needs to be static) and that could lead to confusion.
  </li>
  <li>
    You'd need expensive checks:
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Let's take a look at a code example.
</p>

<pre><code>class Point {
  <em>#x;</em>
  <em>#y;</em>

  constructor(x, y) {
    <em>this.#x</em> = x;
    <em>this.#y</em> = y;
  }
  equals(other) {
    return <em>this.#x</em> === <em>other.#x</em> &amp;&amp; <em>this.#y</em> === <em>other.#y</em>;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  Notice how we're referencing <code>other.#x</code> and <code>other.#y</code>.
  By accessing the private fields, we are assuming that other is an
  <code>instanceof</code> our class <code>Point</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Because we've used the #hashtag syntax we've told the JavaScript compiler
  that we're looking up private properties from the current class.
</p>

<p>
  But what would happen if we didn't use the #hashtag?
</p>

<pre><code>equals(otherPoint) {
  return <em>this.x</em> === <em>otherPoint.x</em> &amp;&amp; <em>this.y</em> === <em>otherPoint.y</em>;
}</code></pre>

<p>
  Now we have a problem: How do we know what <code>otherPoint</code> is?
</p>

<p>
  JavaScript doesn't have a static type system, so <code>otherPoint</code>
  could be anything.
</p>

<p>
  Which is a problem for two reasons:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Our function behaves differently depending on what type of value you pass
    to it: Sometimes accessing a private property, other times looking up a
    public property.
  </li>
  <li>
    We'd have to check the type of <code>otherPoint</code> every single time:
  </li>
</ol>

<pre><code>if (
  <em>otherPoint instanceof Point</em> &amp;&amp;
  <em>isNotSubClass(otherPoint, Point)</em>
) {
  return getPrivate(otherPoint, 'foo');
} else {
  return otherPoint.foo;
}</code></pre>

<p>
  Even worse, we'd have to do this for every single property access within a
  class to check if we're referencing a private property.
</p>

<p>
  Property access is already really slow, so we definitely do not want to add
  any more weight to it.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>TL;DR:</strong> We need to use a <code>#hashtag</code> for private
  properties because the alternative of using standard property accesses would
  create unexpected behavior and result in huge performance problems.
</p>

<p>
  Private fields are an awesome addition to the language. Thanks to all the
  wonderful hardworking people on TC39 who made/are making them happen!
