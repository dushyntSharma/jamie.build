    <h1>A fucking rant about fucking <code>const</code> vs fucking <code>let</code></h1>

    <p>
      I didn't want to be the guy write this post, but I am because Chris told
      me to so blame that fuckin guy. I'm a victim here.
    </p>

    <p>
      But you're all using <code>const</code> in JavaScript too much and it
      does bug me just ever so little.
    </p>

    <h3>1. <code>const</code> doesn't do shit and we all know it</h3>

    <p>
      For starters, let's agree that <code>const</code> is fucking useless and
      we're inventing meaning...
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE = { right: "?" };
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.right = <em>"wrong"</em>;
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.<em>fucking</em> = <em>"deal with it"</em>;</code></pre>

    <p>
      <code>const</code> does not imply any kind of immutability of the value
      itself, it only implies immutability of the <em>binding</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Which... Cool.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The linters can't save you now</h3>

    <p>
      Let's also eliminate the idea that we could somehow statically enforce
      that <em>const</em> values are immutable with a linter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like, sure, you could for the simple case:
    </p>

    <pre><code>const FOO = { prop: true };
FOO.prop = false; <em>// LINT ERR >XD</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      But then like... side effects exist and shit will hurt you
    </p>

    <pre><code>export function mutatesProp(obj) {
  obj.prop = false;
}</code></pre>

    <pre><code>import { mutatesProp } from './mutatesProp';
const FOO = { prop: true };
mutatesProp(FOO); <em>// no lint err :(</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      And yeah, type systems like Flow and <a class="breakmeupinside" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=have%20you%20tried%20typescript&src=typd">HiHaveYouTriedTypeScriptYouShouldReallyTryTypeScriptIWriteTypeScriptAndImFuckingObnoxiousImGonnaStickMyHeadInAMicrowaveAndScreamTypeScriptâ„¢</a> could do
      <em>something</em> with this, but like... they don't... sooooo
    </p>

    <h3>3. No it's not useful for compilers</h3>

    <p>
      You might be thinking, "Oh but it can still be used to optimize code or
      whatever"
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be right in thinking that compiler optimizations would make it
      interesting enough to use. But...
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be wrong in thinking that <code>const</code> is at all useful
      to optimizing compilers.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's already really really easy to identify a binding and figure out if
      it's never reassigned. All of the relevant optimizations are already
      possible without <code>const</code> ever being a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, V8 and friends have been doing these optimizations without
      <code>const</code> for a really long time. Benedikt or Franziska or
      whoever can correct me if I'm wrong, but Babel definitely can already do
      this shit.
    </p>

    <h3>4. So what are we going to do?</h3>

    <p>
      First off, like... we don't <em>have</em> to <em>do</em> anything. There is no
      reason you would ever <em>have</em> to use <code>const</code>, and
      whereever we are using it, we could just as easily use <code>let</code>
      and our code wouldn't be impacted in any way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Honestly, if you just want to stop here and never use <code>const</code>
      again and never question it further, you will save literally whole...
      minutes of your life.
    </p>

    <p>
      But like... we <em>have</em> <code>const</code> so why don't we use it for
      <em>something</em> ...right? We could like use it to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sure.
    </p>

    <h3>5. But what you've chosen to communicate is stupid and annoying</h3>

    <p>
      So, lots of people (okay maybe not you, you special little shit) are
      doing this... <em>thing</em> where they change every <code>let</code>
      variable which is never re-assigned to <code>const</code>.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      They would see the above code and say "that <code>let</code> should be a
      <code>const</code> so that the reader knows at the declaration of
      <code>answer</code> that it never changes."
    </p>

    <p>
      And many of them will include linter tools for enforcing that rule on
      every variable declaration, even sometimes applying the "fix"
      automatically.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      "That's better."
    </p>

    <p>
      But... is it better?
    </p>

    <p>
      Did you <em>really</em> mean to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> that
      we should never change the <code>answer</code> or do we just
      <em>happen</em> to never change it?
    </p>

    <p>
      What if we came along later and decided we are okay changing the answer?
      But now it's a <code>const</code> and we aren't really sure if we're
      going to break someone's expectation for <code>answer</code> if we do
      change it.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are lots of bindings that we <em>happen</em> to never change that
      we're totally fine if they do change. In fact, that's probably true for
      <em>most</em> bindings. It's not something your code will generally care
      about.
    </p>

    <p>
      But by automatically applying this rule to every binding no matter what
      the author's actual intent was, we actually throw out our opportunity to
      <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> something.
    </p>

    <h3>6. So what should we actually use <code>const</code> for?</h3>

    <p>
      It's probably still a good idea to communicate that you really
      <em>don't</em> intend for something to be changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in order to communicate that, we need to only use it when
      appropriate.
    </p>

    <pre><code>const I_ACTUALLY_GIVE_A_SHIT_IF_THIS_CHANGES = 42;</code></pre>

    <p>
      If you want some good rules to follow, here's my best attempt:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>1. Only use <code>const</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <pre><code>const <em>HERE</em> = "is okay";

function nested() {
  const <em>NOT_HERE</em> = "never seen a reason to";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      I'm pretty sure I've never seen a binding created in a function that will
      actually be upset if it changes. I never use <code>const</code> inside
      nested scopes, and I don't intend to. Why? Because my mom raised me
      right (see my usage of semicolons), that's why.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2. Avoid using <code>let</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, if you need to use <code>let</code> at the top-level
      scope, that's a sign you have some sort of global singleton state which
      could cause you problems.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let globalState</em> = "hmmm...";

function fn() {
  <em>globalState =</em> "this seems fragile to test...";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      And like... that's basically it...
    </p>

    <p>
      And for the love of all that is not shit, please don't try enforcing this
      with a linter. Let people communicate what they want to communicate.
      Ya'll drive me crazy with that shit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now get the fuck out of my house.
