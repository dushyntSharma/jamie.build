  When you have a large enough application, a single large bundle with all of
  your code becomes a problem for startup time. You need to start breaking your
  app into separate bundles and load them dynamically when needed.
</p>

      A single giant bundle vs. multiple smaller bundles
    </p>
  </footer>
</section>

<p>
  How to split a single bundle into multiple is a well solved problem with
  tools like <a href="https://github.com/substack/factor-bundle">Browserify</a>
  and <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">Webpack</a>.
</p>

<p>
  But now you need to find places in your application where you can decide to
  split off into another bundle and load it asynchronously. You also need a way
  to communicate in your app when something is loading.
</p>

<h3>
  Route-based splitting vs Component-based splitting
</h3>

<p>
  A common piece of advice you will see is to break your app into separate
  routes and load each one asynchronously. This seems to work well enough for
  most apps, clicking on a link and loading a new page is not a terrible
  experience.
</p>

<p>
  But we can do better than that.
</p>

<p>
  Using most routing tools for React, a route is simply a component. There's
  nothing particularly special about them. So what if we optimized around
  components instead of delegating that responsibility to routes? What would
  that buy us?
</p>

<p>
  It turns out quite a lot. There are many more places than just routes where
  you can pretty easily split apart your app. Modals, tabs, and many more UI
  components hide content until the user has done something to reveal it.
</p>

<p>
  Not to mention all the places where you can defer loading content until
  higher priority content is finished loading. That component at the very
  bottom of your page which loads a bunch of libraries: Why does that need to
  be loaded at the same time as the content near the top?
</p>

<p>
  You can still easily split on routes too since they are simply components.
  Just do whatever is best for your app.
</p>

<p>
  But we need to make splitting up at the component-level as easy as splitting
  at the route-level. To split in a new place should be as easy as changing a
  few lines of app code and everything else is automatic.
</p>

<h2>
  Introducing React Loadable
</h2>

<p>
  React Loadable is a small library I wrote to make component-centric code
  splitting easier in React.
</p>

<p>
  Loadable is a higher-order component (a function that creates a component)
  which makes it easy to split up bundles on a component level.
</p>

<p>
  Let's imagine two components, one that imports and renders another.
</p>

<pre><code><em>import AnotherComponent from './another-component';</em>

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <em>&lt;AnotherComponent/&gt;</em>;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  Right now we are depending on <code>AnotherComponent</code> being imported
  synchronously via <code>import</code>. We need a way to make it loaded
  asynchronously.
</p>

<p>
  Using a <strong>dynamic import</strong>
  (<a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import">a tc39 proposal
  currently at stage 3</a>) we can modify our component to load
  <code>AnotherComponent</code> asynchronously.
</p>

<pre><code>class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    AnotherComponent: null
  };

  componentWillMount() {
    <em>import('./another-component')</em>.then(AnotherComponent =&gt; {
      this.setState({ AnotherComponent });
    });
  }

  render() {
    let {AnotherComponent} = this.state;
    <em>if (!AnotherComponent) {
      return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
    } else {
      return &lt;AnotherComponent/&gt;;
    };</em>
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  However, this is a bunch of manual work, and it doesn't even handle a lot of
  different cases. What about when the <code>import()</code> fails? What about
  server-side rendering?
</p>

<p>
  Instead you can use <code>Loadable</code> to abstract away the problem. Using
  Loadable is simple. All you need to do is pass in a function which loads your
  component and a "Loading" component to show while your component loads.
</p>

<pre><code><em>import Loadable from 'react-loadable';</em>

function MyLoadingComponent() {
  return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
}

<em>const LoadableAnotherComponent = Loadable({
  loader: () =&gt; import('./another-component'),
  LoadingComponent: MyLoadingComponent
});</em>

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <em>&lt;LoadableAnotherComponent/&gt;</em>;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  But what if the component fails to load? We need to also have an error state.
</p>

<p>
  In order to give you maximum control over what gets displayed when, the
  <code>error</code> will simply be passed to your
  <code>LoadingComponent</code> as a prop.
</p>

<pre><code>function MyLoadingComponent({ <em>error</em> }) {
  if (<em>error</em>) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Error!&lt;/div&gt;;
  } else {
    return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
  }
}</code></pre>

<h3>
  Automatic code-splitting on <code>import()</code>
</h3>

<p>
  The great things about <code>import()</code> is that Webpack 2 can actually
  automatically split your code for you whenever you add a new one without any
  additional work.
</p>

<p>
  This means that you can easily experiment with new code splitting points just
  by switching to <code>import()</code> and using React Loadable. Figure out
  what performs best on your app.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable-example">You can see
  an example project here</a>. Or
  <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting-import/">read the
  Webpack 2 docs</a> (Note: some of the relevant docs are also in
  <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting-require/">the
  require.ensure() section</a>).
</p>

<h3>
  Avoiding Flash Of Loading Component
</h3>

<p>
  Sometimes components load really quickly (&lt;200ms) and the loading screen
  only quickly flashes on the screen.
</p>

<p>
  A number of user studies have proven that this causes users to perceive
  things taking longer than they really have. If you don't show anything, users
  perceive it as being faster.
</p>

<p>
  So your loading component will also get a <code>pastDelay</code> prop which
  will only be <code>true</code> once the component has taken longer to load
  than a set <code>delay</code>.
</p>

<pre><code>export default function MyLoadingComponent({ error, <em>pastDelay</em> }) {
  if (error) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Error!&lt;/div&gt;;
  } else if (<em>pastDelay</em>) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
  } else {
    return null;
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  This <code>delay</code> defaults to <code>200ms</code> but you can also
  customize the delay using a third argument to <code>Loadable</code>.
</p>

<pre><code>Loadable({
  loader: () =&gt; import('./another-component'),
  LoadingComponent: MyLoadingComponent,
  <em>delay: 300</em>
});</code></pre>

<h3>
  Preloading
</h3>

<p>
  As an optimization, you can also decide to preload a component before it gets
  rendered.
</p>

<p>
  For example, if you need to load a new component when a button gets clicked
  you could start preloading the component when the user hovers over the
  button.
</p>

<p>
  The component created by <code>Loadable</code> exposes a <code>preload</code>
  static method which does exactly this.
</p>

<pre><code>let LoadableMyComponent = Loadable({
  loader: () =&gt; import('./another-component'),
  LoadingComponent: MyLoadingComponent,
});

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = { showComponent: false };

  onClick = () =&gt; {
    this.setState({ showComponent: true });
  };

  onMouseOver = () =&gt; {
    <em>LoadableMyComponent.preload();</em>
  };

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;button
          onClick={this.onClick}
          onMouseOver={this.onMouseOver}&gt;
          Show loadable component
        &lt;/button&gt;
        {this.state.showComponent &amp;&amp; &lt;LoadableMyComponent/&gt;}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    )
  }
}</code></pre>

<h3>
  Server-side rendering
</h3>

<p>
  Loader also supports server-side rendering through one final argument.
</p>

<p>
  Passing the exact path to the module you are loading dynamically allows
  Loader to <code>require()</code> it synchronously when running on the server.
</p>

<pre><code>import path from 'path';

const LoadableAnotherComponent = Loadable({
  loader: () =&gt; import('./another-component'),
  LoadingComponent: MyLoadingComponent,
  delay: 200,
  <em>serverSideRequirePath: path.join(__dirname, './another-component')</em>
});</code></pre>

<p>
  This means that your async-loaded code-splitted bundles can render
  synchronously server-side.
</p>

<p>
  The problem then comes with picking back up on the client. We can render the
  application in full on the server-side but then on the client we need to load
  in bundles one at a time.
</p>

<p>
  But what if we could figure out which bundles were needed as part of the
  server-side bundling process? Then we could ship those bundles to the client
  all at once and the client picks up in the exact state the server rendered.
</p>

<p>
  You can actually get really close to this today.
</p>

<p>
  Because we have the all the paths for server-side requires in
  <code>Loadable</code>, we can add a new <code>flushServerSideRequires</code>
  function that returns all the paths that ended up getting rendered
  server-side. Then using <code>webpack --json</code> we can match together the
  files with the bundles they ended up in
  (<a href="https://gist.github.com/thejameskyle/abecfe8ec2a7ce1e312a904527a31908">
  You can see my code here</a>).
</p>

<p>
  The only remaining issue is to get Webpack playing nicely on the client. I'll
  be waiting for your message after I publish this Sean.
</p>

<p>
  There's all sorts of cool shit we could build once this all integrates
  nicely. React Fiber will enable us to be even smarter about which bundles we
  want to ship immediately and which ones we want to defer until higher
  priority work is complete.
</p>
