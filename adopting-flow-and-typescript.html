<p>
  Let's imagine a scenario where we want to adopt a type checker...
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  Lately we've been noticing a lot of NaN's show up in our app. We search for
  the source and find the following code:
</p>

<pre><code>// math.js
function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}
square("oops");</code></pre>

<p>
  We sigh to ourselves, and decide maybe it's finally time to add a type
  checker. We step back and take a look at our options:
  <a href="https://flow.org/">Flow</a> or
  <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>.
</p>

Both of these tools have fairly simple file-by-file adoption:

<ul>
  <li>
    Flow: Add a <code>// @flow</code> comment to the top of your file
  </li>

  <li>
    TypeScript: Change the <code>.js</code> extension to a <code>.ts</code>
    extension
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  But let's compare what happens from there.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>
  Adopting TypeScript
</h2>

<p>
  To adopt TypeScript, we'll first rename <code>math.js</code> to
  <code>math.ts</code>:
</p>

<pre><code>// math.ts
function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}
square("oops");</code></pre>

<p>
  Now we'll run typescript:
</p>

<pre><code>(no errors)</code></pre>

<p>
  There are no errors because TypeScript requires that we type annotate our
  function before it will check the type like this:
</p>

<pre><code>function square(n: number): number {
  return n * n;
}
square("oops");</code></pre>

<p>
  But without those types, TypeScript will do one of two things depending on
  your configuration:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Implicitly cast every unknown type to <code>any</code>. This any type will
    opt you out of all type checking.
  </li>
  <li>
    Or if you're using the <code>--noImplicitAny</code> option, it will throw
    an error for any unknown types, requiring you to add type annotations.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  This means that the amount of code <em>covered</em> by TypeScript is tied to
  the types that you have written. Type coverage goes up <em>linearly</em> as
  you write types.
</p>

<h2>
  Type Coverage
</h2>

<p>
  Before we go any further, I should explain what type coverage is.
</p>

    alt="Uncovered code shown in red"/>

      Uncovered code shown in red
    </p>
  </footer>
</section>

<p>
  If you look at the values and expressions in your code and asked the type
  checker "do you know what type this is?".
</p>

<p>
  If the type checker knows the type, then that value or expression is covered.
  If the type checker does not know the type then it's not covered.
</p>

<p>
  The percentage of code for which the type checker knows the type is the "type
  coverage" of your program.
</p>

<p>
  You want your programs to have as much type coverage as possible because then
  it will be able to tell you when you've made mistakes in more places.
</p>

<p>
  Without type coverage, a type checker is nothing.
</p>

<h2>
  Adopting Flow
</h2>

<pre><code>// @flow
function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}
square("oops");</code></pre>

<p>
  Then we'll run Flow and see the results:
</p>

<pre><code>function square(n) {
  return n * n;
         <em>^</em>   <em>^</em>
         <em>Error (x2)</em>
}
square("oops");

<em>Error (x2)
string. The operand of an arithmetic operation must be a number.</em></code></pre>

<p>
  Immediately we have type errors that tell us <em>something</em> has gone
  wrong.
</p>

<p>
  Flow only requires us to type the exports of a file and the external modules.
  Everything else can be <em>inferred</em>.
</p>

<p>
  This makes type coverage go up much faster. With just a few types you can
  quickly get files with really high type coverage.
</p>

<p>
  In my experience, I can get files covered to about 70–90% in just a few
  minutes.
</p>

<p>
  Here's a <em>super scientific</em> graph of the difference:
</p>

  <img
    src="img/adopting-flow-and-typescript-graph.png"
    alt="Graph showing Flow coverage going up much earlier on than TypeScript"/>
</section>


<p>
  This isn't my personal opinion, you can go out and try this for yourselves
  and see the difference a few types makes.
</p>

<p>
  To see the type coverage of a file in Flow you can run:
</p>

<pre><code>flow coverage path/to/file.js --color</code></pre>

<p>
  You can also use

  to help you out.

    <s>
      <strong>Note:</strong> I'm not aware of any type coverage reporting tools
      for TypeScript (please send me a link if you know of one!). But you can
      test if code is covered by testing to see if it reports errors when you do
      something wrong.

<h2>
  How does this work?
</h2>

<p>
  The reason these two tools have such different adoption behaviors comes down
  to the difference between their architectures.
</p>

<h3>TypeScript Architecture: AST-directed</h3>

<p>
  TypeScript will <em>walk</em> through your program and build up a table of
  known types. As it discovers values and expressions it assigns types to them
  immediately. When TypeScript discovers an unknown type it must make a
  decision immediately, which means either assigning it to <code>any</code> or
  throwing an error.
</p>

<h3>Flow Architecture: Graph-directed</h3>

<p>
  Flow will build up a graph of all your values and expressions and their
  relationships to one another. It will then start to assign types to each
  value and expression. If it finds an unknown type it will make it an "open"
  type and come back to it later.
</p>

<p>
  Once Flow has a full graph of your program it will start to connect all the
  dots, flowing types from one value to another. Open types take on the types
  of all the values that flow into them– the resulting type is called the
  <em>inferred</em> type.
</p>

<p>
  You can watch this happening. Let's take a look at the type errors we got
  with Flow before:
</p>

<pre><code>function square(n) {
  return n * n;
         <em>^</em>   <em>^</em>
         <em>Error (x2)</em>
}
square("oops");

<em>Error (x2)</em>
<em>string. The operand of an arithmetic operation must be a number.</em></code></pre>

<p>
  Notice how error is pointing to the <code>n * n</code> rather than
  <code>square("oops")</code>. Because we didn't write a type for n the
  <code>"oops"</code> string flowed into it and Flow started checking n as if
  it were a string.
</p>

<p>
  Adding a type annotation we can see the error move:
</p>

<pre><code>function square(n: number) {
  return n * n;
}
square("oops");
       <em>^ Error</em>

<em>Error: string.</em>
<em>This type is incompatible with the expected param type of number.</em></code></pre>

<p>
  This raises an important point: Just because Flow can infer types everywhere
  doesn't mean that you shouldn't add type annotate your code.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  Both TypeScript and Flow have really good on-boarding processes. Going
  file-by-file is a great experience.
</p>

<p>
  However, if you use Flow, you'll have much higher type coverage much faster
  and you'll be able to sleep <em>soundly</em>.
</p>

<p>
  With Flow you'll be adding types to make errors nicer, not to uncover them.
